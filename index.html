	<p>For me, my school is more than simply an educational institution; </br>
it is also my second family, which I established during my childhood. </br>
A family of wonderful friends, outstanding teachers, and fond school memories.</br>
 I adore my school because it is where I learn how to be a good citizen and how to reach my goals.</p>
